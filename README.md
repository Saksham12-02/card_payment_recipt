# card_payment_recipt

Developed a simple Card Payment System in Python to simulate real-world payment processing.
The project collects user inputs (card number, holder name, expiry date, amount), stores them in a class, and generates a formatted payment receipt with transaction details.
This project demonstrates OOP concepts, user input handling, and receipt generation, making it a beginner-friendly implementation of financial transaction systems.
